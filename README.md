# CS-305-Software-Security

-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client is Artemis Financial, a company that specializes in individual finacial plans for their customers. The main issue that was needing to be addressed was security from external threats

-What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I have learned how to fix and prevent software security vulnerabilities, and the best first step is to understand and know what the vulnerabilities look like and how to prevent them. Coding while keeping security in mind can help prevent any future problems or vulnerabilities from occuring, actively being secure now will help greatly in the future. Having a strong software security shows that a company is responsible with their information and provides trust between the company and its users or customers.

-What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The hardest part of the assessment was learning what the vulnerabilities looked like and what I should be doing to prevent the said vulnerabilities.

-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security I would use input validation, cryptography, APIs, and Authorizations to prevent any external threats from taking place. Manually reviewing code can help prevent any missed problems as well as doing dependency checks to find vulnerabilities.

-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Running a dependecny check can show what needs to be updated and what vulnerabilities were found. After refactoring the code, rerunning the dependency check can find any new vulnerabilities.

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The important practice I have learned is to code with security in mind. This can help future tasks as by coding securely now will prevent any mistakes in the future or at the very least lower the amount of security work after code is finished.

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show employers that I do now about good security practices as well as how to search and fix vulnerabilities I have found in the software.
